EP00-US04 NGINX Configuration

As a developer I want the application to served by NGINX so that I can manage the api endpoints and app endpoints on the same hostname and prepare for scaling.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. There is an NGINX configuration folder and file in the application
2. There is a Dockerfile in the configuration folder
3. There is a docker-compose service for NGINX
4. `docker-compose up` brings up NGINX
5. `docker-compose up` no longer exposes ports 8000, 9000, 3000 etc... and only exposes 80
