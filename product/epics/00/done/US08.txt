EP00-US08 - WSGI configuration

As a developer, I want the application served by uWSGI rather than the django
development server so that I know the configuration of development is closer
to a production environment.

Acceptance Criteria

1. When `docker-compose up` is run, the application is accessible as usual
2. The backend does not launch the "python manage.py runserver" command
3. The backend launches a uwsgi command.
4. Static files continue to be accessible.
5. Media files continue to be accessible.
